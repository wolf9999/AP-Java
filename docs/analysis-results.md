Column 1: total_bill Total Records Processed: 244

Minimum Value: 3.07 Maximum Value: 50.81 Average Value: 19.79 Range: 47.74 This is notable because $50.81 is not a high total bill considering the party sizes range up to 6 people. This value corresponds to a 3 person party, which is reasonable. I was surprised to find out the 6 person party spent less though.

Column 2: tip Total Records Processed: 244

Minimum Value: 1.00 Maximum Value: 10.00 Average Value: 3.00 Range: 9.00 This is notable as the tip range is pretty high, and the average value is closer to the lower end. This makes me think about what made the outlier want to tip $10.00.
